Mingxi Hu is a Ph.D. Candidate in Geology at The Pennsylvania State University. His research integrates core- to outcrop-scale sedimentology, stratigraphy, and geochemistry to resolve depositional heterogeneity and basin evolution. Specifically, he investigates glacioeustatic versus climatic controls on mixed carbonate-siliciclastic system architecture using stratigraphy, stable isotopes, and forward modeling.

Prior to joining Penn State, Mingxi received his M.S. in Earth Sciences from Washington University in St. Louis and a B.A. in Geology from Colorado College, with additional industry experience in prospect risk assessment and seismic interpretation through the SEG EVOLVE program.
